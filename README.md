ilyvion's Laboratory is a library/framework mod for use by my other mods to avoid code duplication across my mods. Anyone is free to make use of this as a dependency, but I don't want to promise that things won't break for third parties, so depend on it at your own risk. I'll do my utmost to prevent breakage, though, so there's a very low (but still non-zero) chance you'll be screwed.
