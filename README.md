> You might be used to downloading people's GitHub mods by using the **Code -> Download ZIP** method, but this won't work on my repos[^badpractice]; I make use of proper releases and you can always find the latest version of the mod for download on the [Releases page](https://github.com/ilyvion/ilyvion-laboratory/releases/latest).


ilyvion's Laboratory is a library/framework mod for use by my other mods to avoid code duplication across my mods. Anyone is free to make use of this as a dependency, but I don't want to promise that things won't break for third parties, so depend on it at your own risk. I'll do my utmost to prevent breakage, though, so there's a very low (but still non-zero) chance you'll be screwed.

Just to be perfectly clear: **_I take no responsibility whatsoever if your mod blows up due to me making a change to this mod â€” depend on it at your own risk and don't @ me if something breaks for you!_**

[^badpractice]: I think this is really bad practice, but I won't fault less experienced developers for not setting up a whole build and release workflow since it's a rather advanced DevOps topic. Still, you won't find me doing it because, again, I think it's really bad practice for a whole host of reasons.
